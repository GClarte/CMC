# CMC
Code for the simulations of Collective Monte Carlo

testtargets.R : contains the tested targets
methods.R : CMC, PMC and PMH
KSgaussian.R : KS distances for the gaussians
KScauchy.R : idem for Cauchy's
histograms.R : histograms
ACF.R : autocorrelation functions


Many of the simulations are useless in the plots as we selected only the interesting ones, but we have left all the simulations in the code.
